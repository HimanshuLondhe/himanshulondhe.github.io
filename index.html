<h1 id="projects">PROJECTS</h1>
<h3 id="enhanced-support-vector-machine-with-speed-up-and-reduced-sensitivity-aug-2017-mar-2018-">Enhanced Support Vector Machine with Speed Up and Reduced Sensitivity [ Aug 2017 - Mar 2018 ]</h3>
<p>Improved the Classification Accuracy of Linear Support Vector Machines by 8-13% by designing a data pre-
possessing module which reduces ’scatteredness’ of the data. <strong>[ Python, sklearn, pandas, Matplotlib ]</strong></p>
<h3 id="a-card-playing-artificial-intelligent-bot-sept-2019-dec-2019-">A Card Playing Artificial Intelligent Bot [ Sept 2019 - Dec 2019 ]</h3>
<p>Successfully developed a bot from scratch that plays a trick taking card game that uses memory heuristics,
follows predefined rules and mimics the thinking of the programmer.<strong>[ Python ]</strong></p>
<h3 id="attack-prediction-in-networks-using-machine-learning-oct-2019-dec-2019-">Attack Prediction in Networks using Machine Learning [ Oct 2019 - Dec 2019 ]</h3>
<p>Designed and Implemented a Network Attack Detector using Support Vector Machines in python with an
accuracy of 93.96%. Network activity data-set was provided by IEEE knowledge-pit challenge. <strong>[ Python,
sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib ]</strong></p>
<h3 id="android-factory-image-installer-jan-2017-mar-2017-">Android Factory Image Installer [ Jan 2017 - Mar 2017 ]</h3>
<p>Developed a script which automatically installs an Android Factory Image on a target device with a minimalist
GUI. Script was able to achieve automation in process of installing a new image onto a Nexus device The script
can be easily scaled out to other bootloader unlockable devices.<strong>[ Android, AVD,ABD,shell script, zenity]</strong></p>
<h3 id="fall-detection-classifier-using-cnn-computer-vision-feb-2020-may-2020-">Fall Detection Classifier using CNN - Computer Vision [ Feb 2020 - May 2020 ]</h3>
<p>Implemented a Concurrent Neural Network to process and classify sequences of video streams into fall/no-fall
events with an accuracy of 92-95%.<strong>[ Python, SKlearn, keras, tensorflow ]</strong></p>
<h3 id="centralized-multi-user-concurrent-bank-account-manager-sept-2019-dec-2019-">Centralized Multi-User Concurrent Bank Account Manager [ Sept 2019 - Dec 2019 ]</h3>
<p>Designed and Developed a Bank Server that handles multiple clients and does so using distributed programming
concepts.<strong>[ C++, sockets, mutexes, fault tolerance ]</strong></p>
