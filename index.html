Master in Computer Science [ GPA - 3.67 ]


* Marathwada Mitra Mandals College of Engineering July 2014 - June 2018
Savitribai Phule Pune University
Bachelor of Engineering, Computer Science. [ Overall Percentage: 69% ]

# PROJECTS
### Enhanced Support Vector Machine with Speed Up and Reduced Sensitivity [ Aug 2017 - Mar 2018 ]
Improved the Classification Accuracy of Linear Support Vector Machines by 8-13% by designing a data pre-
possessing module which reduces ’scatteredness’ of the data. **[ Python, sklearn, pandas, Matplotlib ]**

### A Card Playing Artificial Intelligent Bot [ Sept 2019 - Dec 2019 ]
Successfully developed a bot from scratch that plays a trick taking card game that uses memory heuristics,
follows predefined rules and mimics the thinking of the programmer.**[ Python ]**

### Attack Prediction in Networks using Machine Learning [ Oct 2019 - Dec 2019 ]
Designed and Implemented a Network Attack Detector using Support Vector Machines in python with an
accuracy of 93.96%. Network activity data-set was provided by IEEE knowledge-pit challenge. **[ Python,
sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib ]**

### Android Factory Image Installer [ Jan 2017 - Mar 2017 ]
Developed a script which automatically installs an Android Factory Image on a target device with a minimalist
GUI. Script was able to achieve automation in process of installing a new image onto a Nexus device The script
can be easily scaled out to other bootloader unlockable devices.**[ Android, AVD,ABD,shell script, zenity]**

### Fall Detection Classifier using CNN - Computer Vision [ Feb 2020 - May 2020 ]
Implemented a Concurrent Neural Network to process and classify sequences of video streams into fall/no-fall
events with an accuracy of 92-95%.**[ Python, SKlearn, keras, tensorflow ]**

### Centralized Multi-User Concurrent Bank Account Manager [ Sept 2019 - Dec 2019 ]
Designed and Developed a Bank Server that handles multiple clients and does so using distributed programming
concepts.**[ C++, sockets, mutexes, fault tolerance ]**
